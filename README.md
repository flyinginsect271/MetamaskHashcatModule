# NEW Metamask Hashcat Module

Test Metamask's new encryption algorithm improvements! For educational purposes only.

Not long ago, Metamask updated the hashing algorithms for wallets; guessing passwords for them through the standard module (26600) in Hashcat became impossible.
We implemented support for the new encryption algorithm in the module and compiled it.

## Installation Guide

- Just unpack 26650(.dll/.so) in the /modules/ directory.
